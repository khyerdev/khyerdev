### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am `khyernet`, a 16 year old software programmer / software designer. I only do these things for fun right now. I am teaching myself various stuff that i shouldn't even learn until college. Things like Rust, Arch Linux, Neovim, and other stuff. I have been doing this stuff since 2021.

I am also a contributor to [emanfm.isso.moe](https://emanfm.isso.moe), a "radio station" for the ULTRAKILL youtuber [Emancipation](https://www.youtube.com/@emancipationvevo), since I worked on 99% of the frontend.

I own the domains [khyernet.xyz](https://khyernet.xyz) and [khyer.dev](https://khyer.dev). I am currently working on the website for khyernet.xyz. I am doing the frontend in raw HTML/CSS/JS and the backend in Rust. DNS, SSL/TLS, and security are managed by Cloudfare. However, khyer.dev will only be used as a link shortener, so that I dont have to remember long URLs when sending things to people.

One thing I struggle with is asking for help.
