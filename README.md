### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am `khyernet`, a 15 year old software programmer / software designer. I only do these things for fun right now. I am taking AP Computer Science Principles in school right now, but I am also teaching myself various other stuff that i shouldn't even learn until college. Things like Rust, Arch Linux, Neovim, and other stuff. I have been doing this stuff since 2021.

I am also a contributor to [emanfm.isso.moe](https://emanfm.isso.moe), a "radio station" for the ULTRAKILL youtuber [Emancipation](https://www.youtube.com/@emancipationvevo), since I worked on 99% of the frontend.

I am currently working on [tcobalt](https://github.com/OSCH2008/tcobalt), a command-line wrapper for wukko's [cobalt.tools](https://cobalt.tools), which is an open-source video/audio downloader for many services, without any ads, trackers, or SEO exploitation. tcobalt is currently available in the AUR for Arch Linux.

One thing I struggle with is asking for help.
